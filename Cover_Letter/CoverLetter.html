	Dear Hiring Manager,
I am writing to express my interest in a position within your Quality function, specifically in Quality Control, Quality Assurance, Continuous Improvement, or Computer Systems Validation (CSV). With over five years of experience in GMP-regulated pharmaceutical environments, I bring strong expertise in analytical chemistry, compliance, investigation management, and process improvement. In addition, I have recently begun a Level 8 qualification in Computing in Science (Software Development) at the National College of Ireland, which is enhancing my technical foundation for supporting CSV and digital transformation initiatives within pharma.
In my current role as a QC Chemist at Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, I perform testing across raw materials, APIs, DPIs, stability, and finished products, while ensuring compliance with batch release timelines. I lead investigations into deviations, manage change controls, and drive method transfer and validation projects. I am also experienced in troubleshooting and maintaining analytical platforms including HPLC, UPLC, GC, LCMS, and Empower 3.
At Pfizer, I advanced from QC Analyst to QC Specialist, where I supported batch release, validation, regulatory inspections (HPRA and FDA), and cross-functional collaboration with QA and technical teams. I successfully led improvement projects that eliminated release backlogs and contributed to multiple audit successes, demonstrating my ability to combine compliance with operational efficiency.
What excites me about changing from my current role, is the chance to contribute not only my laboratory and compliance expertise but also my passion for continuous improvement, system optimisation, and digital solutions. My ongoing studies in computing and software development reflect my commitment to building the technical skills needed to support future-focused areas such as CSV, data integrity, and system validation. I also have ambition to grow, so I am hoping your company can support me with my progression journey.
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and evolving skill set can contribute to your Quality and CSV initiatives. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of speaking with you.
Sincerely,
Erin McEvoy
    </p>
